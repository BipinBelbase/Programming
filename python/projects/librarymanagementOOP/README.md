### **1. Plan the Core Features**  
You’ll need to decide what your library system will do.  
- **Manage Books**: Add, remove, or search for books.  
- **Manage Members**: Register members, delete members, or search for member details.  
- **Borrow/Return Books**: Issue books to members and manage returns.  
- **Data Storage**: Save books, members, and borrow records to files so the system retains data after restarting.  

---

### **2. Design the Classes**  
Think of the key components of a library and represent them as classes.  

1. **Book Class**  
   - Properties: `title`, `author`, `isbn`, `status` (e.g., available, issued).  
   - Methods: `update_status`, `display_info`.  

2. **Member Class**  
   - Properties: `name`, `member_id`, `borrowed_books` (list of borrowed books).  
   - Methods: `borrow_book`, `return_book`, `display_info`.  

3. **Library Class**  
   - Properties:  
     - A list of `Book` objects.  
     - A list of `Member` objects.  
   - Methods:  
     - Add or remove books.  
     - Register or delete members.  
     - Search for books or members.  
     - Issue books to members and handle returns.

### **3. Implement Core Functionalities**  
Break the project into manageable parts.  

#### **A. Add/Remove Books**  
- Allow the librarian to add a book by entering its title, author, and ISBN.  
- Remove books by searching for the ISBN and deleting the record.  

#### **B. Add/Remove Members**  
- Add new members with a unique `member_id` (auto-generate this).  
- Remove members based on their ID.  

#### **C. Search for Books/Members**  
- Search books by title, author, or ISBN.  
- Search members by name or `member_id`.  

#### **D. Borrow and Return Books**  
- Borrow a book:  
  - Check if the book is available.  
  - Update the book’s status to “issued.”  
  - Add the book to the member’s `borrowed_books`.  
- Return a book:  
  - Update the book’s status to “available.”  
  - Remove the book from the member’s `borrowed_books`.  

---

### **4. Add Persistent Data Storage**  
- Use **JSON or plain text files** to store the books and members.  
- When the program starts, load data from these files into memory.  
- Save updates to the files whenever changes are made.  

---

### **5. Add User Interaction**  
- Create a menu-based system where users can:  
  1. Add a book  
  2. Remove a book  
  3. Register a member  
  4. Search for a book/member  
  5. Borrow/return a book  
  6. Exit the program  

- Use a simple loop to keep the program running until the user exits.  

---

### **6. Test Your Program**  
- Add some sample books and members.  
- Test all features, especially edge cases:  
  - What happens if a user tries to borrow a book that’s already issued?  
  - What happens if a user tries to return a book they didn’t borrow?
