**** Trees ****

### **Graphs**

YOUTUBE OPEN GL OPERATING SYS




2025-01-29-Wednesday
Graph and trees 
and codeforce or leethor nooo JUST DO YOUTUBE DSA QUESTIOINS SOLVING 5 HOURS OR LIKE DSA CONCEPT BUILDING OR GATE WALLAH DSA QUESTIONS OR CODEACADEMY INTERVIEWQUESTIONS OF DSA 


.....................
think also about time complexity 
leetcode easy questions 
codeforces (div 3 or 4 for beginner)

2025-02-02-Sunday
pandas...alll..advanced
YT >> Matpotlip.matpotlip
read book and finish it .....

2025-02-03,04 .... continued youtube all completed....daily one hourrrr ..


READ BOOKS---
Readers are leaders
learn das ..
make python notes .. revised all things
learn DJANGO WEBDEB 
LEARN SQL
study all remaining datastructure and algorithm advanced 
codeforces questions 
leetcode questions

















AFTER THAT 
CONSISTENCY MATTERS 
WRITE DOWN 
HANDWRITTEN

Daily 1 to 5 only questions easy or medium without looking 
consistency is key just one question or two but at least one is important.. build momentum
at least one contest per wek in codeofrce
buy book 
"Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
Focus on learning, not perfection. Every hard problem teaches you something new.


Open a problem rated 800.
Read it carefully and break it into smaller steps.
Write and test your code locally or in the online editor.
Submit your solution and analyze feedback.


### **Projects**

- Build a Text Autocomplete System (Trie + Heuristic search).
- Implement a File Compression Tool (Huffman Encoding).
- Create a Mini Database Engine (HashMap + B-Trees).
- Develop a Social Network Graph Analysis Tool (Graph traversal + BFS/DFS).



just try to do 80/20 percent rule 

! If we estimate around 7,000 problems combined from LeetCode and Codeforces, and you solve 300 problems per year, it would indeed take about 23â€“24 years to solve them all.



Itâ€™s not about being perfect; itâ€™s about improving consistently. Many of the top competitive programmers started at the same level as you. By practicing regularly, you'll get better and tackle harder problems over time! ðŸš€
