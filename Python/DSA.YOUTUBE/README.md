"Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
Focus on learning, not perfection. Every hard problem teaches you something new.


Open a problem rated 800.
Read it carefully and break it into smaller steps.
Write and test your code locally or in the online editor.
Submit your solution and analyze feedback.


### **Projects**

- Build a Text Autocomplete System (Trie + Heuristic search).
- Implement a File Compression Tool (Huffman Encoding).
- Create a Mini Database Engine (HashMap + B-Trees).
- Develop a Social Network Graph Analysis Tool (Graph traversal + BFS/DFS).



just try to do 80/20 percent rule 

! If we estimate around 7,000 problems combined from LeetCode and Codeforces, and you solve 300 problems per year, it would indeed take about 23â€“24 years to solve them all.



Itâ€™s not about being perfect; itâ€™s about improving consistently. Many of the top competitive programmers started at the same level as you. By practicing regularly, you'll get better and tackle harder problems over time! ðŸš€
